        <li>1/2 tsp salt ($0.03)</li>
        <li>¾ cup +2 Tbsp warm milk* ($0.02)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp melted butter ($0.20)</li>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>
          In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter,
          sugar, and vanilla extract.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the bowl of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and
          stir just until combined. The mixture should be thick, but still
          pourable, and a little bit lumpy. Let the batter rest for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium. Once hot add enough
          cooking oil to coat the surface (I use about ½ tsp per pancake). Add
          the pancake batter to the hot griddle, ¼ cup at a time. Use the back
          of the measuring cup to spread the batter into a 4.5-inch diameter
          circle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the pancakes until bubbles form over the surface and begin to
          pop, the edges of the pancakes look dry, and the bottom is golden
          brown (about 60 seconds). Flip the pancakes and cook on the second
          side until golden brown (about 30 seconds).
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil to the skillet
          between batches or as needed, until all of the pancakes have been
          cooked. Keep the pancakes warm on a plate under a towel or in a warm
          oven until all of the pancakes have been cooked. Serve warm with your
          favorite toppings!
