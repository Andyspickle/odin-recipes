      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prepare the marinade first. Stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar,
          water, garlic, ginger, and 1 Tbsp of the cooking oil in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the chicken in a shallow bowl or dish, then pour the marinade
          over top. Turn the chicken a couple of times to make sure it's well
          coated. Let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes to one day
          (refrigerated), turning the chicken occasionally as it marinates.
        </li>
        <li>
          When ready to cook the chicken, heat the remaining 1 Tbsp cooking oil
          in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken,
          discarding the remaining used marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side or until cooked
          through and the liquid in the skillet has reduced to a light coating
          of glaze on the chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for about 5
          minutes before slicing and serving.
